      FAQTitle:"How did QuarryChain begin?",
      FAQText:" QuarryChain was originally developed as a Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain network back in the summer of 2021. The main idea behind the name was based on the concept of “CryptoCurrency Mining”, where you have a metaphorical term that describes users competing against each other with specialized computing hardware to solve complex mathematical puzzles to get in return a block reward. This usually takes a lot of effort and time, therefore miners (block validators) will get together and pool their resources to form “Mining Pools” to lower costs and of course increase their power and chances of mining future blocks. However, in real life when people such as contractors/miners/ companies come together and pool their resources to collectively mine something, we do not call these places “Mining Pools” but instead we call them “Quarries”. Blockchain can therefore be easily thought out as a “Digital Quarry”, where users are actively “mining” blocks and coming together through industries throughout the entire world."

      FAQTitle:"What makes QuarryChain “Advanced”?",
      FAQText:"The QuarryChain Network uses an innovative Delegated Proof of Stake consensus mechanism in which 20 - 30 elected Quarry Miners (QMs) produce blocks for the network. Every 6 hours, QuarryChain account holders who freeze their accounts can vote for a selection of QM candidates, with the top 20 - 30 candidates deemed the QMs. Voters may choose QMs based on criteria such as projects sponsored by QMs to increase QuarryChain's Token adoptions, and rewards distributed to voters. This allows for a more democratized and decentralized ecosystem. Quarry Miner accounts are normal accounts, but their accumulation of votes allows them to produce blocks. QuarryChain's DPoS system offers an innovative mechanism resulting in 20,000 - 100,000 TPS (Transactions per second)"

      FAQTitle:"What is the Governance like on QuarryChain?",
      FAQText:"The Community (Stakeholders) need to have the ability to elect those with specific skills, public credibility, and expertise to fill the roles that are lacking in the system. Every account in the QuarryChain Network can apply and have the opportunity to become a Quarry Miner ( denoted as QM). Everyone can vote for QM candidates. The top 20 - 30 candidates with the most votes will become QMs with the right and obligation to generate blocks.The most important thing that QuarryChain’s DPoS Governance offers is democratization & transparency, and so to become a Miner in this case is a much more thorough process and one that requires the trust and confidence of the stakeholders & community."

      FAQTitle:"How does one Vote on QuarryChain?",
      FAQText:"  To vote for a Quarry Miner, a user will first need to freeze their Quarry Coins. This will create “Quarry Power” and give you the power to vote. This will not cost the user their Quarry Coins, but will only lock them for a certain period of time. Quarry Power is essentially Bandwidth Points, Bandwidth is the unit that measures the size of the transaction bytes stored within QuarryChain’s database, the larger the transaction the more bandwidth resources will be consumed.  More bandwidth points can also be obtained by staking more QRY. Elections are going to be held daily to elect Quarry Miners who will produce blocks for the network The Main incentive to participate in Voting Rounds will be the ability to earn a daily APY reward from the blocks being produced by the Quarry Miner that they voted for."
