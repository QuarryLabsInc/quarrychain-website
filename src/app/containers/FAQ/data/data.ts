      FAQTitle:"How did QuarryChain begin?",
      FAQText:" QuarryChain was originally developed as a Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain network back in the summer of 2021. The main idea behind the name was based on the concept of “CryptoCurrency Mining”, where you have a metaphorical term that describes users competing against each other with specialized computing hardware to solve complex mathematical puzzles to get in return a block reward. This usually takes a lot of effort and time, therefore miners (block validators) will get together and pool their resources to form “Mining Pools” to lower costs and of course increase their power and chances of mining future blocks.<br/> <br/>However, in real life when people such as contractors/miners/companies come together and pool their resources to collectively mine something, we do not call these places “Mining Pools” but instead we call them “Quarries”. Blockchain can therefore be easily thought out as a “Digital Quarry”, where users are actively “mining” blocks and coming together through industries throughout the entire world."

      FAQTitle:"What makes QuarryChain “Advanced”?",
      FAQText:" The QuarryChain Network uses an innovative Delegated Proof of Stake consensus mechanism in which 27 Senior Representatives (SRs) produce blocks for the network. Every 6 hours, QuarryChain Token account holders who freeze their accounts can vote for a selection of SR candidates, with the top 27 candidates deemed the SRs. Voters may choose SRs based on criteria such as projects sponsored by SRs to increase QuarryChain's Token adoptions, and rewards distributed to voters. This allows for a more democratized and decentralized ecosystem. SRs' accounts are normal accounts, but their accumulation of votes allows them to produce blocks. QuarryChain's DPoS system offers an innovative mechanism resulting in 20,000 - 100,000 TPS (Transactions per second)  compared to Bitcoin's 3 TPS and Ethereum's 15 TPS."

      FAQTitle:"What is the Governance like on QuarryChain?",
      FAQText:"  The Community (Stakeholders) need to have the ability to elect those with specific skills, public credibility, and expertise to fill the roles that are lacking in the system. Every account in the QuarryChain Network can apply and have the opportunity to become a Senior Representative ( denoted as SR). Everyone can vote for SR candidates. The top 27 candidates with the most votes will become SRs with the right and obligation to generate blocks. The votes are counted every 6 hours and the SRs will change accordingly."

      FAQTitle:"What is QuarrySwap?",
      FAQText:"  QuarrySwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX, for short), and one of QuarryChain's first Applications. QuarrySwap also happens to be non-custodial, meaning that unlike centralized exchanges, Quarryswap does not need to possess your tokens in order for you to be able to trade them. Instead, QuarrySwap allows users to trade trustfully, peer-to-peer, with liquidity that is supplied by other users. This means that new projects can easily connect to their desired markets as long as some entity is willing to provide the liquidity."
